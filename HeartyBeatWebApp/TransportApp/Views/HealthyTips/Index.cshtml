            <h1>Heart-healthy diet changes</h1>

            <h3>⤷Manage excess body fat</h3>
            <p>Research in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology has linked excess
                belly fat to higher blood pressure and unhealthy blood lipid levels. If you’re
                carrying extra fat around your middle, it may be time to make lifestyle adjustments.
                Eating fewer calories and watching your portion sizes more can make a big difference.</p>

            <h3>⤷Include fiber into your diet</h3>
            <p>
                According to the Mayo Clinic, a diet rich in soluble fiber can help lower your level
                of low-density lipoprotein, or “bad cholesterol.” Sources of soluble fiber include beans, oats, barley, apples, pears, and avocados.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Make time for breakfast</h3>
            <p>
                The first meal of the day is an important one. Eating a nutritious breakfast every
                day can help you maintain a healthy diet and weight. To build a heart-healthy meal, reach for:
                <br />
                - whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole-grain cereals, or whole-wheat toast<br />
                - lean protein sources, such as turkey bacon or a small serving of nuts or peanut butter<br />
                - fruits and vegetables<br />
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Eat fish</h3>
            <p>
                Eating a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can also help ward off heart disease. Many fish,
                such as salmon, tuna, sardines, and herring, are rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids. <br />
                <br />
                Try to eat fish at least twice a week, suggests the AHATrusted Source. If you’re concerned
                about mercury or other contaminants in fish, you may be happy to learn that its heart-healthy
                benefits tend to outweigh the risks for most people.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Eat nuts</h3>
            <p>
                Almonds, walnuts, pecans, and other tree nuts deliver a powerful punch of heart-healthy fats, protein, and
                fiber. Including them in your diet can help lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. <br />
                <br />
                Remember to keep the serving size small, suggests the AHATrusted Source. While nuts are
                full of healthy stuff, they’re also high in calories.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Limit your salt intake</h3>
            <p>
                If the entire U.S. population reduced its average salt intake to half a teaspoon a day, it would
                significantly cut the number of people who develop coronary heart disease every year, report researchers
                in the New England Journal of Medicine. <br />
                <br />
                The authors suggest that salt is one of the leading drivers of rising healthcare costs in the United States. Processed
                and restaurant-prepared foods tend to be especially high in salt.
                <br />
                So think twice before filling up on your favorite fast-food fix. Consider using a salt substitute,
                such as Dash, if you have high blood pressure or heart failure.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Reduce your saturated fat intake</h3>
            <p>
                Slicing your saturated fat intake to no more than 7 percent of your daily calories can cut your risk of heart
                disease, advises the USDA. If you don’t normally read nutrition labels, consider starting today. Take stock of what
                you’re eating and avoid foods that are high in saturated fat. <br />
                <br />
                Instead, you can switch your unhealthy fat intake with healthy fats, such as avocados, olive oil, and eggs.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Drink tea</h3>
            <p>
                No magic is needed to brew a cup of green or black tea. According to the AHATrusted Source, drinking
                one to three cups of tea per day may help lower your risk of heart problems. For example, it’s linked to
                lower rates of angina and heart attacks.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Eat dark chocolate</h3>
            <p>
                Dark chocolate not only tastes delicious, it also contains heart-healthy flavonoids. These compounds help
                reduce inflammation and lower your risk of heart disease, suggest scientists in the journal Nutrients.<br />
                <br />
                Eaten in moderation, dark chocolate — not oversweetened milk chocolate — can actually be good for you.
                The next time you want to indulge your sweet tooth, sink it into a square or two of dark chocolate. No guilt required.
            </p>

            <h1>Incorporating exercise into your routine</h1>

            <h3>⤷Move your body throughout the day</h3>
            <p>
                No matter how much you weigh, sitting for long periods of time could shorten your lifespan,
                warn researchers in the Archives of Internal MedicineTrusted Source and the American Heart AssociationTrusted Source.<br />
                <br />
                Couch potato and desk jockey lifestyles seem to have an unhealthy effect on blood fats and blood sugar. If you work at a desk,
                remember to take regular breaks to move around. Go for a stroll on your lunch break, and enjoy regular exercise in your leisure time.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Practice yoga</h3>
            <p>
                Yoga can help you improve your balance, flexibility, and strength. It can help you relax and relieve stress. As if that’s not enough,
                yoga also has potential to improve heart health.<br />
                <br />
                According to research published in the Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary & Alternative MedicineTrusted Source, yoga has the potential
                to reduce one’s risk of cardiovascular disease.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Try strength training</h3>
            <p>
                Aerobic fitness is key to keeping your heart healthy, but it’s not the only type of exercise you should do. It’s also important to include
                regular strength training sessions in your schedule.<br />
                <br />
                The more muscle mass you build, the more calories you burn. That can help you maintain a heart-healthy weight and fitness level.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Try interval training</h3>
            <p>
                Start and stop, then start and stop again. During interval training, you alternate bursts of intense physical activity with bouts of lighter
                activity. The Mayo Clinic reports that doing so can boost the number of calories you burn while working out.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Try dancing</h3>
            <p>
                Whether you prefer a rumba beat or two-step tune, dancing makes for a great heart-healthy workout. Like other forms of aerobic exercise,
                it raises your heart rate and gets your lungs pumping. It also burns up to 200 calories or more per hour, reports the Mayo Clinic.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Go for a walk</h3>
            <p>
                The next time you feel overwhelmed, exasperated, or angry, take a stroll. Even a five-minute walk can help clear your head and lower your
                stress levels, which is good for your health. Taking a half-hour walk every day is even better for your physical and mental health.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Take the stairs</h3>
            <p>
                Exercise is essential for good heart health, so why not sneak it in at every opportunity? Take the stairs instead of the elevator.
                Park on the far side of the parking lot. Walk to a colleague’s desk to talk, instead of emailing them. <br />
                <br />
                Play with your dog or kids at the park, instead of just watching them. Every little bit adds up to better fitness.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Use housework as exercise</h3>
            <p>
                Vacuuming or mopping the floors may not be as invigorating as a Body Slam or Zumba class. But these activities
                and other household chores do get you moving.<br />
                <br />
                They can give your heart a little workout while burning calories, too. Put your favorite music on and
                add some pep to your step while you complete your weekly chores.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Eat dark chocolate</h3>
            <p>
                Fitness doesn’t have to be boring. Let your inner child take the lead by enjoying an evening of roller
                skating, bowling, or laser tag. You can have fun while burning calories and giving your heart a workout.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Mental health and heart health</h1>

            <h3>⤷Engage in hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                Put your hands to work to help your mind unwind. Engaging in activities such as knitting, sewing, and crocheting
                can help relieve stress and do your ticker some good. Other relaxing hobbies, such as woodworking, cooking, or
                completing jigsaw puzzles, may also help take the edge off stressful days.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Laugh out loud</h3>
            <p>
                Don’t just LOL in emails or Facebook posts. Laugh out loud in your daily life. Whether you like watching funny movies
                or cracking jokes with your friends, laughter may be good for your heart.<br />
                <br />
                According to the AHAT rusted Source, research suggests laughing can lower stress hormones, decrease inflammation in
                your arteries, and raise your levels of high-density lipoprotein (HLD), also known as “good cholesterol.”
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Manage your stress</h3>
            <p>
                A sunny outlook may be good for your heart, as well as your mood. According to the Harvard T. H. Chan School
                of Public Health, chronic stress, anxiety, and anger can raise your risk of heart disease and stroke.
                Learning ways to manage your stress and anxiety may help you stay healthier for longer.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Know your numbers</h3>
            <p>
                Keeping your blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglycerides in check is important for good
                heart health. Learn the optimal levels for your sex and age group.<br />
                <br />
                Take steps to reach and maintain those levels. And remember to schedule regular check-ups with
                your doctor. If you want to make your doctor happy, keep good records of your vitals or lab
                numbers, and bring them to your appointments.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Consider pet therapy</h3>
            <p>
                Our pets offer more than good company and unconditional love. They also provide
                numerous health benefits. Studies reported by the National Institutes of Health
                (NIH) suggest that owning a pet may help improve your heart and lung function.
                It may also help lower your chances of dying from heart disease.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Take the scenic route home</h3>
            <p>
                Put down your cell phone, forget about the driver who cut you off,
                and enjoy your ride. Eliminating stress while driving can help lower
                your blood pressure and stress levels. That’s something your
                cardiovascular system will appreciate.
            </p>

            <h3>⤷Takeaway</h3>
            <p>
                There are many changes you can make to help keep your heart healthy and strong. Improving your diet,
                engaging in physical activity, and taking care of your mental health can all help with heart health. <br />
                <br />
                If you aren’t sure where to begin, speak with a medical professional about your concerns,
                and they can help create a treatment plan that works for your needs and lifestyle.
